# Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars using machine learning techniques. The price of a car depends on several factors such as its year of manufacture, present market price, total kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission type, seller type, and number of previous owners. Accurately estimating a car’s value helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

In this project, a Linear Regression model is developed and trained on a real-world dataset containing historical car information. The dataset is first preprocessed by handling categorical variables through encoding and removing irrelevant features. The processed data is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model’s performance.

The trained model predicts the selling price of cars based on input features and is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score. The results show that the model performs well in estimating car prices, making it suitable for practical use in price prediction systems.

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, and serves as a strong foundation for understanding regression-based prediction problems.
